        <ol type="1" class="custom-ol">
            <li>
                A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser.
                The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date,
                unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies may not contain any information that personally identifies a user, 
                but personal data that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
