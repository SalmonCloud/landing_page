                    Some offences are possible to remedy and upon client remedy, services can be restored. Other, more serious (or recurring offences that are blatantly due to a lack of regard for our policies)
                    may result in permanent suspension and service cancellation. In the event of such permanent suspension and cancellation, services would be terminated for a violation of our Terms of Service 
                    and would not be eligible for any sort of refund (such offences require administrative staff's time to resolve issues with external parties).
